# Flowtide

Welcome to Flowtide. I'm focused on building the best browser extensions that make browsing better.

**Projects:**

### Flowtide - Beautiful New Tab
Flowtide's primary project. This is a beautifully designed, customizable New Tab page for your browser.<br>

### Flowtide Notes - Minimalist Notepad
Flowtide Notes is a side-panel Chrome extension for taking notes. All local. Nice and compact.<br>
